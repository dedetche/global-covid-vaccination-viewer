# Global COVID-19 Vaccination Viewer

This project was developed for the final submission of Stanford's [Code in Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/2025) course.

## Description

This is a simple Python program that allows users to explore real COVID-19 vaccination data across different countries and years. The data comes from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) and is updated in a CSV file.

Users can:

- Enter the name of a country (e.g., `Brazil`, `India`, `United States`)
- Choose a year (e.g., `2021`, `2022`)
- View how many people were:
  - Vaccinated with at least one dose
  - Fully vaccinated
  - Boosted with additional doses
- See a bar chart with that information
